# Preface

Performance is about speed, but beyond that, performance is also about achieving possible from impossible. In the last internet bubble, companies such as Blockbuster and Yahoo tried to servce videos or internet file sharing. They failed partly due to lack of infrastructure to meet performance expectations in those days. Today, youtube, dropbox, and other emergy technolgy startups are benefit from fast envoling of internet infrastructures which make faster and richer customer experences possible.

Performance is also about balance and trade-off. In reality, speed is only one of several criterials of success internet services. An e-commerce site may want its customers feel streamline during shopping to keep retention. Meanwhile, it also needs to recommend relavant goods and make a splash by images and videos in order to boost revernue. Its server has to keep a record of users' acvities in order to better understand their behaviour for future businesses. Those features will cut corner of performance in a way or another. Instead of making things faster, a good performance could give a busineess a deepper pocket to speed on other advantage features.

Finally, performance is also about cost. If a company has unlimited budget, there are bunch of fancy but expensive toys to easily burn resources and get up hands in performance, such as distributed in-memory storage grid, SSD or infinity band network. However, one thing industry told us is that the winner comes from those who use captibal most efficient not who owns most. One secret of Google's success is because of its large distributed data processing platform, which turns out to become map-reduce, the fundemental of today's big data industry. A good performance can be translated into efficiency of utilize investments.

Performance is crititcal for average users as well as business owners. Today the average internet accessing time for a US adult is xx hours. xx% of those hours are waiting for response. That means 10% improvement in loading performance can save xx hours every day in US alone, in another words xx % GDP boost estimatly.

Do more, run faster, cost less are the converged goals of technology, science and business. This book is based on my hands-on expereince in daily works as well as academic learning. The result of all those ideas are from years' work cross displine work in browser, data serving, neworking protocal and content delivery network, application development and serving, system architecture, as well as stories from users' aspects. This book is trying to provide a up-to-date and forward looking overview of academic knowledge, popular technologies and crafts about impoving performance of web application. It covers topics in front-end, back-end, network, data storage, and architecture. The challenge for me is how to provide wider topics and make them deep enough to expert readers. I believe the most efficient way of handle a technology is by working on it. Therefore, some of those principles in this book is implemented in two open sourced projects: SpinelJS and HippeJS. They are under MIT license and fully workable. Actually, my startup reflen.com is use them as the front-end JS framwork and the back-end data serving framework.

My journery of pursuit performance start from my struggle to draw a moving circle on my i386 PC smoothly. As the interests become a hobbie and activily working, researching and tracking on the topic for years, I would like to share my thoughts, knowledge and practices with the community. Thanks for Gitbook to provide the publish platform and my family to support me. It's a life-long journey and on-going effort. Internet is a fast evolving area. It would be surprise to find some those ideas will be outdated (some of them actually already be so). I will try to update content of this book. Some of recently updates can be found in my personal blog which dedicated to performance: less than 200ms and the facebook page.
